The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on CSS values. However, there is a potential bug where the calculation produces unexpected results due to operator precedence or missing parentheses. For example, using the expression `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but if you omit the parentheses, as in `width: calc 100% - 10px;` it throws an error.  Another uncommon issue arises when using `calc()` with units that are not compatible. Attempting to add a percentage and a pixel value without proper conversion or explicit units in the formula can lead to calculation errors.
